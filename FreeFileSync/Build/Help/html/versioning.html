	<h1>File Versioning</h1>
	<p>
		When you need to preserve files that have been deleted or overwritten,
		it's often sufficient to select <b>Recycle bin</b> in synchronization
		settings. However, this is only available for local drives and offers
		little control on how to store and how long to keep the files.
		FreeFileSync therefore has an additional option, <b>Versioning</b>.
		<br><br>
	</p>

	<h2>1. Keep only the most recent versions</h2>
	<p>
		In synchronization settings, set deletion handling to <b>Versioning</b> and naming convention to
		<b>Replace</b>. Deleted files will be moved to the specified folder
		without any decoration and will replace already existing older
		versions.<br>

	</p>

	<h2>2. Keep multiple versions of old files</h2>
	<ol type="A">
		<li><p>
				Set deletion handling to <b>Versioning</b>
				and naming convention to <b>Time stamp [File]</b>. FreeFileSync will move
				deleted files into the provided folder and add a time stamp to each
				file name. The structure of the synchronized folders is preserved so
				that old versions of a file can be conveniently accessed via a file
				browser.
			</p>
			<p><b>Example:</b> Last versions of the file <span class="file-path">Folder\File.txt</span> inside folder <span class="file-path">D:\Revisions</span> </p>
			<div class="greybox">
				<div class="file-path">
					D:\Revisions\Folder\File.txt <b>2012-12-12 111111</b>.txt<br>
					D:\Revisions\Folder\File.txt <b>2012-12-12 122222</b>.txt<br>
					D:\Revisions\Folder\File.txt <b>2012-12-12 133333</b>.txt
				</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			
		<li><p>
				With naming convention <b>Time stamp [Folder]</b> files are moved into a time-stamped subfolder
				of the versioning folder while their names remain unchanged.
				This makes it easy to manually undo a synchronization by moving the deleted files from the
				versioning folder back to their original folders.
			</p>
			<p><b>Example:</b> Last versions of the file <span class="file-path">Folder\File.txt</span> inside folder <span class="file-path">D:\Revisions</span> </p>
			<div class="greybox">
				<div class="file-path">
					D:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-12 111111</b>\Folder\File.txt<br>
					D:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-12 122222</b>\Folder\File.txt<br>
					D:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-12 133333</b>\Folder\File.txt
				</div>
			</div>
	</ol>
	<br>
	
	<h2>3. Save versions at certain intervals</h2>
	<p>
		With naming convention <b>Replace</b>
		it is possible to refine the granularity of versions to keep by adding <a href="macros.html">Macros</a>
		to the versioning folder path. For example, you can save deleted files
		on a daily basis by adding the <b><span class="command-line">%date%</span></b> macro:
	</p>
	<p><b>Example:</b> Last versions of the file <span class="file-path">Folder\File.txt</span> inside folder <span class="file-path">D:\Revisions\%date%</span> </p>
	<div class="greybox">
		<div class="file-path">
			D:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-11</b>\Folder\File.txt<br>
			D:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-12</b>\Folder\File.txt<br>
			D:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-13</b>\Folder\File.txt
		</div>
	</div>

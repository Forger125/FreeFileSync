	<h1>File Versioning</h1>
	<p>
		When you need to preserve files that have been deleted or overwritten,
		it's often sufficient to select <b>Recycle bin</b> in synchronization
		settings. However, this is only available for local drives and offers
		little control on how to store and how long to keep the files.
		FreeFileSync therefore has an additional option, <b>Versioning</b>.
		<br><br>
	</p>

	<h2>1. Keep only the most recent versions</h2>
	<p>
		In synchronization settings, set deletion handling to <b>Versioning</b> and naming convention to
		<b>Replace</b>. Deleted files will be moved to the specified folder
		without any decoration and will replace already existing older
		versions.<br>

	</p>

	<h2>2. Keep all versions of old files</h2>
	<p>
		Set deletion handling to <b>Versioning</b>
		and naming convention to <b>Time stamp</b>. FreeFileSync will move
		deleted files into the provided folder and add a time stamp to each
		file name. The structure of the synchronized folders is preserved so
		that old versions of a file can be conveniently accessed via a file
		browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Example:</b>
		A file <span class="file-path">Folder\File.txt</span> was updated three times and old versions were moved to folder <span class="file-path">C:\Revisions</span>
	</p>

	<div class="greybox">
		<div class="file-path">
			C:\Revisions\Folder\File.txt <b>2012-12-12 111111</b>.txt<br>
			C:\Revisions\Folder\File.txt <b>2012-12-12 122222</b>.txt<br>
			C:\Revisions\Folder\File.txt <b>2012-12-12 133333</b>.txt
		</div>
	</div>
	<br>

	<h2>3. Save versions at certain intervals</h2>
	<p>
		With naming convention <b>Replace</b>
		it is possible to refine the granularity of versions to keep by adding <a href="macros.html">Macros</a>
		to the versioning folder path. For example, you can save deleted files
		on a per-sync session basis by adding the <b><span class="command-line">%timestamp%</span></b> macro:
	</p>

	<p><b>Example:</b> Using the dynamically generated folder name <span class="file-path">C:\Revisions\%timestamp%</span></p>

	<div class="greybox">
		<div class="file-path">
			C:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-12 111111</b>\Folder\File.txt<br>
			C:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-12 122222</b>\Folder\File.txt<br>
			C:\Revisions\<b>2012-12-12 133333</b>\Folder\File.txt
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>
		This allows for a simple manual undo by moving the deleted files from the
		last synchronization session back to their original folders. Other
		macros like <b><span class="command-line">%date%</span></b> or <b><span class="command-line">%weekday%</span></b> can be used to reduce the granularity down
		to days and weeks.

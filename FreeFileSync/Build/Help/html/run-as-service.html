	<p>
		RealTimeSync is designed to run as a background process which does not need further attention.
		Depending on your requirements, there are a number of ways to start it automatically.
		Generally, the goal is to execute a command line of the form:
	</p>

	<div class="greybox">
		<div class="command-line">&lt;FreeFileSync installation folder&gt;\RealTimeSync.exe &lt;path to *.ffs_real or *.ffs_batch file&gt;</div>
	</div>
	<br>

	<h2>Example:</h2>

	<div class="greybox">
		<div class="command-line">&quot;C:\Program Files\FreeFileSync\RealTimeSync.exe&quot; &quot;D:\Backup Projects.ffs_real&quot;</div>
	</div>
	<br>

	<ol>
		<li><p>
				RealTimeSync should start monitoring when a user logs in:<br>
				Create a new shortcut, enter the command line from above as target and place it into the Windows autostart folder.
				(Enter <span class="command-line"><b>shell:startup</b></span> in the Windows Explorer address bar to find the folder quickly.)

		<li><p>
				RealTimeSync should be monitoring while Windows is running, irrespective of currently logged in users:<br>
				Create a new task in your operating systems's task scheduler and have it execute the command line above when the system starts.
				See <a href="schedule-batch-jobs.html">Schedule Batch Jobs</a> for an example of how to add a task. Then change
				the user which runs the task to <b>SYSTEM</b> - a special user account always running in the background.

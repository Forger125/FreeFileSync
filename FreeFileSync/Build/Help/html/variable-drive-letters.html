	<h1>Variable Drive Letters</h1>

	<p>
		USB memory sticks or external hard disks often get different
		drive letters assigned when plugged into distinct computers. FreeFileSync
		offers two solutions to handle this problem:
	</p>

	<p><b>Option 1: </b>Specify a folder path by using the volume name:</p>

	<div class="greybox">
		Enter the path as <span class="file-path">[USB-NAME]\folder</span> instead of <span class="file-path">E:\folder</span> where USB-NAME
		is the volume name of the USB stick which is currently mounted in drive <span class="file-path">E:\</span>.
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class="bluebox">
		<b>Note</b><br>
		It is not required to look up and enter the volume name manually. Just select the corresponding entry in the drop down menu.<br>
		<img src="../images/path-by-volume-name.png" class="screen-snippet" alt="Drive letter by volume name">
	</div>
	<br>

	<p><b>Option 2: </b>Use a relative directory name:</p>

	<div class="greybox">
		<ul style="margin: 0">
			<li>Use <span class="file-path">\folder</span> instead of <span class="file-path">E:\folder</span>

			<li>Save and copy synchronization settings to the USB stick: <span class="file-path">E:\Backup.ffs_gui</span>

			<li>Start FreeFileSync by double-clicking on <span class="file-path">E:\Backup.ffs_gui</span><br>
		</ul>
		<br>
		The working directory is then automatically set to <span class="file-path">E:\</span> by the operating system so that the
		relative path <span class="file-path">\folder</span> will be resolved as <span class="file-path">E:\folder</span> during synchronization.
	</div>

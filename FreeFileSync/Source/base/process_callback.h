            1. file cannot be moved -> fallback to copy + delete
            2. file copy, actual size changed after comparison
            3. file contains significant ADS data, is sparse or compressed
            4. file/directory already deleted externally: nothing to do, 0 logical operations and data
            5. auto-resolution for failed create operations due to missing source
            6. directory deletion: may contain more items than scanned by FFS (excluded by filter) or less (contains followed symlinks)
            7. delete directory to recycler: no matter how many child-elements exist, this is only 1 item to process!
            8. user-defined deletion directory on different volume: full file copy required (instead of move)
            9. Binary file comparison: short-circuit behavior after first difference is found
           10. Error during file copy, retry: bytes were copied => increases total workload!
